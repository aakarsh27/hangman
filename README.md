# HANGMAN GAME
## (using random & string in python)
playing the game using the random function of words imported from a text file which creates a hangman-like structure
the objective of the game is to guess the correct set of letters for a random word and you have only 6 wrong guesses

there are a fixed set of words for your reference (https://github.com/aakarsh27/hangman/blob/main/hangman/words.txt)

try guessing the correct word before you hang your person while playing the game
## ! if you fail, this will happen !
